FlyMe2theMoon multi-user interface

I wrote this for my Programming 2 class, where we used Visual Basic code to create OOP applications.
This culminated all the skills I learned in Programming 1 and 2, as well as what I learned in SQL.
It allows customers or admins to log in and do various tasks. These tasks are committed to the database that 
stores all relevant information.

Installation Instructions: I downloaded Visual Studio 2019 and selected the Windows framework. You will also need
Microsoft SQL Server. You will need to download the SQL provided along with the code to run the application correctly.

Usage: This project is meant to allow for one user at a time to interact with it to perform many functions. Customers can 
register for the first time, update their information, book a flight, add another passenger, view previous flight history, and future flight history.
Admins can add employees or update their information. They can also assign them to flights and view their previous and future flight history.
